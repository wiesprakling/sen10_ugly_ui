      <h2>How I’d Improve It</h2>
      <p>
        The interface uses boxes that clashes together creating a poor design that is also clustered.
        It uses tiny fonts, inconsistent image sizes,  and poor spacing. To
        improve it, I’ll use consistent typography, increase white space, and ensure proper alignment for readability.
        Ensure that the products displayed are not clustered and is only limited to avoid suffocation.
